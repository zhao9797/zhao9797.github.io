In 2022, I earned my master's degree from Hebei University of Science and Technology. During 2019 to 2022, I had the opportunity to conduct research as a visiting student at Tsinghua University under the mentorship of Professor Hua Xu. My research interests encompass large language models, reinforcement learning, multimodal information processing, and information extraction, among others.
