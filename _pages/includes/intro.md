In 2022, I earned my master's degree from Hebei University of Science and Technology. From 2019 to 2022, I was a Visiting Postgraduate Student in the [THUIAR](https://thuiar.github.io/) Group at Tsinghua University, conducting research under the supervision of Professor Hua Xu. My research interests encompass large language models, reinforcement learning, multimodal information processing, and information extraction, among others.
